Phase 3 Data Examination Results
================================

**FINAL RESULTS AS OF 2024-07-21 (after merge of PR 155)**

This project is developing a new dataset for use by income and payroll
tax microsimulation models.  The project is progressing in several
phases.  At the end of each phase the current dataset is used as input
to a tax microsimulation model to generate several basic tax
estimates for calendar years 2023 and 2026.  These estimates are
then compared with corresponding estimates generated by federal
agencies using their more comprehensive data.  Examining the
differences between the estimates generated from this project's data
and the estimates published by the federal agencies should provide
ideas about how to improve the development of this project's dataset
in subsequent phases.

For more on the source of the federal agency estimates and on how the
model-plus-dataset estimates are generated, see the [examination
methods](./methods.md) document.  The model used to generate the
following Phase 3 estimates is [Tax-Calculator
4.2.0]((https://github.com/PSLmodels/Tax-Calculator)) (after merge of
PR 2774 on 2024-07-21).

Note that Tax-Calculator assumes 100% participation in credits (like
CTC and EITC), while the federal agencies assume less than 100%
participation.  The implications of the differences in credit
participation assumptions are discussed below the following tables.

**Implication of Differing Credit Participation Assumptions**

Tax-Calculator assumes that everyone eligible for a credit claims it,
while the JCT (and presumably TSY) assumes that some who are eligible
for a credit do not claim it.  Here is what JCT says about its credit
tax expenditure estimates: "Internal Revenue Service (IRS) statistics
from recent tax returns are used to develop projections of the tax
credits, deductions, and exclusions that will be claimed (or that will
be denied in the case of negative tax expenditures) under the
present-law baseline.  These IRS statistics show the actual usage of
the various tax expenditure provisions.  In the case of some tax
expenditures, such as the earned income credit, there is evidence that
some taxpayers are not claiming all the benefits to which they are
entitled, while others are filing claims that exceed their
entitlements.  The tax expenditure calculations in this report are
based on projections of actual claims under the various tax
provisions, not the potential tax benefits to which taxpayers are
entitled." (Quote is from page 18 of the JCX-59-23 publication.)

The only IRS credit participation rates we have found are for the
EITC, and they almost 80% and they are tax-unit participation rates
rather than credit amount (or dollar) participation rates.  (See this
[IRS
document](https://www.eitc.irs.gov/eitc-central/participation-rate-by-state/eitc-participation-rate-by-states).)

Given the differing credit participation assumptions, it should be
expected that the Tax-Calculator CTC and EITC tax expenditures are
above the JCT estimates.  The following calculations, which
arbitrarily assume a 95% dollar participation rate, illustrate how
the differing 2023 estimates are not as far apart as they seem.

| CY23 Amount | Estimate Source |
| ---:   | :---                 |
| 122.1  | CTC JCT (assumes less than 100% participation) |
| 129.2  | CTC Tax-Calculator + phase 3 dataset (100% participation) |
| 122.7  | CTC Tax-Calculator + phase 3 dataset (95% participation) |
|        |                                                          |
| 71.9   | EITC JCT (assumes less than 100% participation) |

| 72.0   | EITC Tax-Calculator + phase 3 dataset (95% participation) |
