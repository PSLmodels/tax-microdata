Phase 3 Data Examination Results
================================

**PRELIMINARY RESULTS AS OF 2024-05-10**

**FINAL RESULTS EXPECTED IN JULY 2024**

This project is developing a new dataset for use by income and payroll
tax microsimulation models.  The project is progressing in several
phases.  At the end of each phase the current dataset is used as input
to a tax microsimulation model to generate several basic tax
estimates for calendar years 2023 and 2026.  These estimates are
then compared with corresponding estimates generated by federal
agencies using their more comprehensive data.  Examining the
differences between the estimates generated from this project's data
and the estimates published by the federal agencies should provide
ideas about how to improve the development of this project's dataset
in subsequent phases.

For more on the source of the federal agency estimates and on how the
model-plus-dataset estimates are generated, see the [examination
methods](./methods.md) document.  The model used to generate the
following Phase 3 estimates is Tax-Calculator 3.6.? version.
