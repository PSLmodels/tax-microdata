# Introduction

Get data for area targeting:

-   States (to come)

-   Congressional districts

Note that each qmd file has its own setup section in which it loads packages and constants. This is unnecessary duplication when rendering the entire project, but it is useful during development because it allows rendering individual qmd files without rendering the entire project.

## Issues and considerations

-   The Congressional District data for 2021 does not have exemptions. Thus, we cannot directly construct exemption targets, and more important this interferes with the current method of using the XTOT target as a way to develop an initial scaling ratio:  `initial_weights_scale = row.target / national_population`. The short term workaround is to create an estimated XTOT target but longer term we should revisit the initial scaling approach. Using the number of filers (returns) may be a better approach.

-   The create_area_weights.py docstring says "There are no district files for states with only one congressional district." There are 7 such states. For these states SOI sets the CONG_DISTRICT variable to 00 and that's what will be used in the CD target files.

-   create_area_weights.py defines `state_info`, which lists the number of CDs in each of the 50 states. It does not list DC, which has a non-voting district (not included in the count of 435 districts). SOI  provides data for this and we should include it, as some policymakers may be interested in the effects of policy changes in the District of Columbia.
