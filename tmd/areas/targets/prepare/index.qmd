# Introduction

Get data for area targeting:

-   States (to come)

-   Congressional districts

Note that each qmd file has its own setup section in which it loads packages and constants. This is unnecessary duplication when rendering the entire project, but it is useful during development because it allows rendering individual qmd files without rendering the entire project.

## Issues and considerations

-   Get 2021 population by Congressional District to create the row 0 "XTOT" (population) target as a way to develop an initial scaling ratio:  `initial_weights_scale = row.target / national_population`.

-   The create_area_weights.py docstring says "There are no district files for states with only one congressional district." There are 7 such states. For these states SOI sets the CONG_DISTRICT variable to 00 and that's what will be used in the CD target files.

-   create_area_weights.py defines `state_info`, which lists the number of CDs in each of the 50 states. It does not list DC, which has a non-voting district (not included in the count of 435 districts). SOI  provides data for this and we should include it, as some policymakers may be interested in the effects of policy changes in the District of Columbia.

-   Per IRS documentation: "Income and tax items with less than 20 returns for a particular AGI class were combined with another AGI class within the same congressional district. Collapsed AGI classes are identified with a double asterisk (dropped) in the Excel files." **This will require attention soon.**

-   We have an issue with AGI: for Congressional Districts IRS does NOT report the number of returns with AGI. They report two variables that should be close in concept: N1 (Number of returns), and N02650 (Number of returns with total income). For all CDs in the U.S. N1 was 157,375,370 in 2021 and N02650 was 155,283,590. Since N1 is larger and is probably a better indicator of total number of filers, we'll use that as the number-of-returns counterpart to AGI (c00100). We address this late in the process because for most of the data development we try to keep the data faithful to what IRS reports and because the solution chosen here may be suboptimal and we may want to change it later.

-   File sizes, GitHub limits, and file types (e.g., binary instead of csv). To discuss.
