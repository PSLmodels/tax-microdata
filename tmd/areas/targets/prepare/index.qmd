# Introduction

The R project in the tax-microdata-benchmarking folder "tmd/areas/targets/prepare/" constructs subnational area targets for:

-   States (to come)

-   Congressional districts (in progress)

In addition, it creates a local web page that a user can upload to a web service if desired. An in-progress version can be viewed on the web [here](https://tmd-areas-prepare-targets.netlify.app/). During development, it may not be identical to what your clone creates.
