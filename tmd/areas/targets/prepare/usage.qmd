# Usage: How to create Congressional District target files and the associated local web page

## Prerequisites

-   Recent version of [R](https://www.r-project.org/). This project was created with R version 4.4.1.
-   Recent release of [RStudio](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/). Other IDEs may work well, but RStudio has been used in this project (RStudio 2024.09.0 Build 375).
-   Recent pre-release version of [quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/download/prerelease.html), 1.6 or higher. This project was created with quarto version 1.6.24
-   Be sure that ".../targets/prepare/cds/raw_data/" exists and has the files shown below. The GitHub repo includes these files:
    -   21incddocguide.docx
    -   cd_documentation_extracted_from_21incddocguide.docx.xlsx
    -   cdpop1year_acs.csv
    -   congressional2021.zip
    -   geocorr2022_2428906586.csv
-   After checking the above and starting RStudio, in the console run `renv::restore()`. `renv` is, in essence, a package manager for R designed to set up a private environment that is the same across multile machines. It should ensure that your environment includes appropriate versions of R packages used in this project (generally loaded in ".../targets/prepare/R/libraries.R").

## To create target files and build the web page

-   Open a terminal in the "prepare" folder.
-   Enter "quarto render"

The first time the project is rendered, it will create needed intermediates files and put them in the "../cds/intermediate" folder.

Note that the \_quarto.yml file sets the `freeze` execution option to `auto`, which means .qmd files will not be rerendered if they have not changed. For a full re-rendering, set `freeze: false`, which will rerender everything regardless of whether code has changed (except that it will not re-render chunks with the option `eval: false`).

At present the code prepares target files with targets we believe are useful and practical. Users who want different targets will have to modify code to do so. However, as described in overall repo documentation, users can comment-out individual targets.

## After rendering is complete

-   target .csv files will be in the ".../targets/prepare/cds/final/" folder
-   local documentation web page will be in the ".../targets/prepare/\_targetprep/" folder

## To create area weights using the target files in tax-microdata-benchmarking

-   copy desired target .csv files from ".../targets/prepare/cds/final/" folder to the ".../targets/" folder
-   follow tax-microdata-benchmarking instructions to run `make_all.py` or \`create_area_weights.py'

## Additional notes

-   It is possible to render each qmd file separately, step by step, to be sure all is working as desired.
-   Each qmd file has its own setup section in which it loads packages and constants. This is unnecessary duplication when rendering the entire project, but it is useful during development because it allows rendering individual qmd files without rendering the entire project.
