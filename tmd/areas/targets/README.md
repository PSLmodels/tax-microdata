Contains sub-national area targets files.


Targets File Content
====================

An areas targets file is a CSV-formatted file with its first row
containing column names and its second row containing the area
population target.  Each subsequent row contains another target.
Rows after the first two that start with a `#` character are
considered comments and are skipped.

Here are the column names and their valid values:

- **`varname`**: ...

- **`count`**: ...

- **`scope`**: ...

- **`agilo`**: ...

- **`agihi`**: ...

- **`fstatus`**: ...

- **`target`**: ...
