Phase 4+ National Data Examination Results
==========================================

**RESULTS AS OF 2024-12-16**

This project is developing a new dataset for use by income and payroll
tax microsimulation models.  The project is progressing in several
phases.  Periodically the current `tmd` dataset files are used as
input to a tax microsimulation model to generate several basic tax
estimates for calendar years 2023 and 2026.  These estimates are then
compared with corresponding estimates generated by federal agencies
using their more comprehensive data.  Examining the differences
between the estimates generated from this project's data files and the
estimates published by the federal agencies should provide ideas about
how to improve the development of this project's dataset in subsequent
phases.

For more on the source of the federal agency estimates and on how the
model-plus-dataset estimates are generated, see the [examination
methods](./methods.md) document.  The model used to generate the
following Phase 6 estimates is [Tax-Calculator
4.3.5](https://github.com/PSLmodels/Tax-Calculator/blob/master/docs/about/releases.md)).
