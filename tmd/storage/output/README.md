# Output files

Three national files suitable for input to Tax-Calculator:
- tmd.csv.gz
- tmd_weights.csv.gz
- tmd_growfactors.csv

Also creates a special purpose file, tmd_2021.csv, that includes 2021 Tax-Calculator output variables and the pre-optimization weight, s006_original. The file is no longer synchronized with tmd.csv and users not familiar with the file and its purpose should not use it.
